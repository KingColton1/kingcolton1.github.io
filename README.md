# UPDATE AS OF MAY 5, 2020
This github repository is no longer used to host website, I've moved them to AWS (Amazon Web Service) for better performance, protection, and greater control. New link can be found at: coltonbailiff.net

# kingcolton1.github.io
A personal portfilo website designed specifically for the resume. This is a open-source website for anyone to use my website design.

This will be a collection of my works from my college course's project(s) and my own personal project to teach myself. My major is Mobile Application Development at Rochester Institute of Technology, specialize in developing cross-platform application using Xamarin in Visual Studio. I've self-taught how to develop an website application using ASP.NET Core (Razor and MVC) as well.

# ASP.NET
This website will be developed in ASP.NET later on, but for now; I will be developing a simple website with only HTML and CSS using Bootstrap (to beautifully stylize the website). However, I will include my ASP.NET projects in my website to show Recruiter that I have experiences with them.
