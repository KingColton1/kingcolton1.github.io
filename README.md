A personal portfilo website designed specifically for the resume. This is a open-source website for anyone to use my website design.

This will be a collection of my works from my college course's project(s) and my own personal project to teach myself. My major is Mobile Application Development at Rochester Institute of Technology, specialize in developing cross-platform application using Xamarin in Visual Studio. I've self-taught how to develop an website application using ASP.NET Core (Razor and MVC) as well.

# Xamarin in Visual Studio
The Xamarin's main language is C# langauge using .NET library. The Mobile Application Development is the only (Associate in Applied Science, AAS) major in the whole Rochester Institute of Technology and only offered for National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) students that teaches how to develop Android, iOS, and Universal Windows Platform app using Xamarin in C# and teaches how to understand & use .NET library for C# programming.

Xamarin is a very powerful tool that allow mobile application developers to be able to code C# language in a single Visual Studio solution for all three platforms (Android, iOS, and Universal Windows). It is statistically rare for any college students that is actually understood the .NET Library, C# language, and Xamarin altogether in a single major.

# ASP.NET
This website will be developed in ASP.NET later on, but for now; I will be developing a simple website with only HTML and CSS using Bootstrap (to beautifully stylize the website). However, I will include my ASP.NET projects in my website to show Recruiter that I have experiences with them.
